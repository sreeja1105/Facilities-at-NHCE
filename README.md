# Facilities-at-NHCE

Developed by using JAVA

The NHCE Facilities Information System will display the number of college facilities like maintenance of library, hostels, data center, physical education, soft skills, laboratories etc.  By this we can maintain a record of the facilities and also reduce the time for the parents to know more about college. 
The main purpose of this is to integrates people, place and process within the built environment. It improving the quality of life of people and the productivity of the core business. So in this project people can know all the details of the college. They have to give there input details like which facility they want to know about.
This project totally deals with the details of college. The manual distribution and display of  college facilities information is very difficult. In a day there may be hundreds or thousands of persons used to ask about the facilities of the college and the hostel. The time required for this will be more and the parents must travel to college to get this information from the authorities.
